Design choices
•	So first of all, everything was put in separate pages instead of cramming them into one page foreasier flow of the website
•	Media queries were also used to ensure responsiveness and that the screen would adapt according to the screen size
•	There was use of a lot of containers in the development to make sure the website was orderly and there was clear distinction between different components 
•	The search bar is only in the product listing page because I saw it wouldn’t be useful in other pages and might just frustrate the user 
•	Images were used in the product listing page not only for aesthetics but for the fact that you can’t just sell a person what they’ve not yet seen
